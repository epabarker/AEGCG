Automated Excel Grade Calculator Generator. Generates an excel spreadsheet to calculate your grades based upon input of modules and module details. 


How to use:

Clone the github, or navigate to the directory where the repository has been downloaded, then run the excelGradeMaker.py in the terminal by doing the following command:

You will then be greeted with a series of questions regarding the structure of your degree. After all questions have been concluded, an excel spreadsheet will be generated in the same directory as the python file.
